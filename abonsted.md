# Project Idea - Social Media Sentiment Search Engine

&emsp; It often feels difficult to keep up with every piece of breaking news, social media drama, and current events updates. Sometimes it can feel overwhelming to keep up with your own life, relationships and career, but at the same time, I also need to ensure that I have a balanced perspective to what else is going on in the world. <br />

&emsp; My proposed group project idea aims to help close the gap between one’s own knowledge and current events. My idea is to make a pseudo-search engine where a user provides a topic, current event, popular figure, etc. and there will be a curated result of recent news events connecting to the user’s topic as well as general reactions from people on social media to show the user how people are reacting to the topic. Users can immediately understand what is happening and how the consensus reactions are to it. Unlike normal search engines, there won’t be a heap of overwhelming information thrown at the user. It will return a short summary, links to news articles to read more, and will focus on reactions from people on social media. This project would be intended to be used by the everyday person. Anyone regardless of background or career could find this resource useful and benefit from it. <br />

&emsp; On the technical side, some of the major features of this project would include a search engine and the results to the search could include a summary, links to external news sites, social media posts. Other features could include allowing users to download this information as a pdf and having an account system to save their searches. Because this project is a web-based project, HTML, CSS, and Javascript would be utilized to build the front-end. Python would also be used for web scraping to get the results to the user submitted topic.
