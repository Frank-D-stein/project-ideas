# Game Day - Sports Analytics for High School Sports 

## Project Proposal 

The project aims to provide players, coaches, and parents to analyze, understand, and improve their performance. This project will be the first step in creating a platform for high school sports players, with the goal of expanding to other interests in the future. 

## Problem Solved 

High school sports players often struggle to understand their performance and find ways to improve. Coaches may not have the time or resources to provide detailed performance analysis, and parents may not have the expertise to help. The solution will provide a platform that helps players understand their performance and helps them identify areas for improvement. 

## Major Features 

1. Performance Analysis: The platform will provide detailed performance analysis for each player, including statistics such as tackles, interceptions, and touchdowns. 

2. Game Film Analysis: Players will be able to watch their own game film and see their performance in real-time. They will be able to identify their strengths and weaknesses and make adjustments accordingly. **Later feature**

3. Practice Performance: The platform will track a player's performance during practice and weightlifting, allowing them to see their progress and improvement over time. 

4. Data Visualization: Players will be able to see their performance in a visual format, making it easier to understand and identify trends. 

## Languages, Tool Sets, and Third-Party Code 

The platform will be developed using the following technologies: 

- Programming Languages: Python, JavaScript 

- Tool Sets: Django and React (open to others)

- Third-Party Code: Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly 

## Who Would Buy/Use This Solution
