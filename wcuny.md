## Project Idea - Will Cuny

## Quizlet Random Tester

### Summary:

This project idea is a website where you can enter a link to a quizlet study set and your phone number, and the website will send you pop quizzes at random times throughout the day. The website would allow you to login and enter your phone number. The user would then submit a link to a quizlet set that they want to study. Our website would scrape the information off of the quizlet and create questions based off the data. There are baseline features listed below, and more complex features would appear throughout the scrum sprints. There would be unique learning features that incoorperte strategies backed by real life educational studies. Overall this project would encorperate all ascpects of software engineering and fullstack development

### What Problem is Being Solved:

This idea introduces a new and refreshing way to study. Instead of trying to cram all information into one study session, this website allows you to spread yourstudying out over multiple days. This, in turn, creates more concrete memorization patterns that allow users to better retain information.

### Major Features:

1. Sign in with Google
2. Select the frequency of texts
3. Style of quiz questions
4. Multiple quizlet sets at once
5. "Slumdog Millionaire" Feature (To be explained)

### Langauge/Tool sets:

1. JavaScript/CSS/HTML
2. Something to host the text service
3. A database to store the users data and quizlet sets
4. OAuthentification via google that allows for a seemless login experience
