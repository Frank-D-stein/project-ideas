# Railway and Bus Tracking system:

## SUMMARY:
	I would like to implement a system that would be tracking trains, railways, and buses in real time. This would include giving the user accurate estimates of arrival time, where the train/bus is at that point in time on a map and perhaps even a system that lets you purchase a ticket. 

## PROBLEM BEING SOLVED
	Trains and buses are notorious for running late with no accurate estimate of arrival time. This can be very frustrating when you have to get to a meeting or another important occasion where you must be on time. Furthermore, having a system to pruchase ticekts can be very convenient. 

## MAJOR FEATURES
	Major features would include the train/Bus tracking software that would accurately track the train and Bus and plot it on a map but also convey the accurate arrival time. Furthermore, there would be some sort of purchasing system that would enable the user to purchase tickets from anywhere for anyone. 

## TOOLS
	I plan on using c++ and some python if it is needed. I am not sure how I will be using these tools yet but I am sure that these should suffice. Furthermore, I am sure if this will be a phone app since that will require some other special languages for appliations or a desktop application that would be on a website. Anyway I plan on utilizing a public train API to enable all the practical processes. 

## CUSTOMERS
    I think anyone that rides trains would be interested in this application. Governments that might want to apply this system to their own public railway system or even just regular people that would like some accurate information on the train or Bus they are trying to catch. This could also apply to Industry personal as well as they have to ahdere to very strict time standards.
