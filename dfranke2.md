##Railway and Bus Tracking system:

##SUMMARY:
	I would like to implement a system that would be tracking trains, railways, and buses in real time. This would include giving the user accurate estimates of arrival time, where the train/bus is at that point in time on a map and perhaps even purchase a ticket. 

##PROBLEM BEING SOLVED
	Trains and buses are notorious for running late with no accurate estimate of arrival time. This can be very frustrating when you have to get to a meeting or another important occasion where you must be on time. Also having a ticket purchase system would be simply convenient. 

##MAJOR FEATURES
	Major features would include the train tracking software that would accurately track the train and plot it on a map but also convey the accurate arrival time. Furthermore, there would be some sort of purchasing system that would enable the user to purchase systems from anywhere for anyone. 

##TOOLS
	I plan on using c++ and some python if it is needed. I am not sure how I will be using these tools yet but I am sure that these should suffice. Furthermore, I am sure if this will be a phone app since that will require some other special languages for appliations or a desktop application that would be on a website. Anyway I plan on utilizing a public train API to enable all the practical processes. 

##CUSTOMERS
I think anyone would buy this software. From countries with nationalized railway systems that can apply this software to their own systems to users in any country the service is available. With countries such as Germany having a grand railway system this could be very attractive. But also industry personal workers who have to adhere to certain time restraints.
