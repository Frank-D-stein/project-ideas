# Project Proposal
### Schedule Maker for University Course and Professor Recommendations 

*This project proposes a solution to the time-consuming and challenging task of selecting university courses and professors. Our schedule maker will assist students in making informed decisions by providing comprehensive information about available professors and courses. The tool will provide a list of professors for each class, including average ratings sourced from popular student review websites such as Rate My Professors, Rate My Teachers, Uloop, and more. Additionally, the schedule maker will display the required courses for a selected major and suggest the best semester placement based on prerequisites and availability.*

### Key Features:
- Professor Recommendations: The schedule maker will provide recommendations for professors based on their ratings, making it easier for students to choose the right professor for their course.
- User-Friendly Interface: The schedule maker will have a user-friendly interface, making it easy for students to navigate through the university catalog and find the classes they need based on their chosen major and previously completed classes.
- Automated Data Retrieval: The schedule maker will be able to read required classes from the university's DARS report, removing the need for manual data entry and making the scheduling process more efficient.
Save Schedules for Future Reference: Students will be able to save their schedules using their university ID for future reference, making it easier to plan for future semesters.
- Prerequisite Conflict Check: The schedule maker will include a feature that checks for prerequisite conflicts, ensuring that students are able to take the required classes in the right order.
- Schedule Optimization: The schedule maker will consider additional data from the student, such as preferred class times, to suggest the best schedule that minimizes big gaps between classes.

The schedule maker will be developed using ***Python*** as the primary programming language, utilizing popular libraries such as ***Pandas***, ***NumPy***, and ***BeautifulSoup***. ***PyQt*** will be used for the user interface, and the application will be primarily developed as a desktop application with the potential for mobile deployment using ***Kivy***, a cross-platform Python framework.

**Target Market:** The target market for the schedule maker is students who are registering for classes. The product will be marketed to universities and colleges and offered for purchase through their online portals or for a yearly cost. The schedule maker will provide a valuable solution to the time-consuming and challenging task of selecting university courses and professors, making it easier for students to plan their academic journey.
